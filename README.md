## Demo

Watch the [demonstration video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vrR_7di46JsCZij8MlSzKIauNkmG_7Jt/view?usp=share_link) hosted on google drive.

## Installation

Clone the app to your machine, then run `npm i`. You will need a MongoDB server running for the server to connect to.

Optionally, you may run `npm run seed` to fill the database with test data to verify that the get routes work.

## Usage

Run `npm start`. You can now connect to the routes with the frontend tool of your choice.
